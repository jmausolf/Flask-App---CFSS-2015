# FLASK WEB APP

This application creates a locally hosted website that highlights several elements of my work on collecting presidential speech data from the White House, Office of the Press Secretary. 

This FLASK App was designed to run on MAC OSX running an Anaconda version of Python. Other systems may not fully work. 

More information on my White House Speech Project is available at my other GitHub repositories:
